This project was made by me as a personal proof of concept project to play with ReactJS and Bootstrap while making a good looking design.

It's a faux dog adoption site where you can view available dogs.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `json-server --watch db.json --port 3001`

Runs the json server to render the list of dogs.

## To Do

1. Add Filtering of Dog List
2. Add Pagination to Dog List
3. Add "adding" Capabilities to Dog List
4. Add Login
